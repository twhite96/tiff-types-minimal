[SkyCorp Video](https://www.youtube.com/@skycorphomevideo) is the most random recommendation I've ever received from YouTube. 

It's a 90s infomercial-like channel that is equal parts Kids in the Hall and Black Mirror.

I was genuinely surprised with how well these are made, how true to the time period they are, and some of which were just utterly terrifying, in a quasi Black Mirror way.
