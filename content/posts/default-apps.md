What are yours?


[^1]: I am unfortunately still out of work and I've had to find creative ways to cut back on expenses. I self host a lot of services where I am staying, my friend's mom letting me setup my home lab in my room. I can host these services for free. It is not for the faint of heart; if you hate tinkering, if you hate doing research on bug fixing and troubleshooting, if you hate learning how to secure a network and fight the bots that will inevitably pummel your network with junk packets, if you hate YAML, it isn't for you.
[^2]: I am looking at moving away from as many proprietary services as I can so FreshRSS, another self-hosted alternative to RSS backends will be my move. NetNewsWire has the option to grab your feeds from your own self-hosted RSS service.
[^3]: I love 1Password. I have everything in it. The problem for me right now is affordability. I don't think it is possible for me to switch as it's just too important to my workflow; ssh keys, GitHub tokens, all of this built right into the client. It's just too good.
[^4]: I am testing out Vaultwarden as a 1Password alternative. It is an open source client you can, *surprise surprise*, self-host. It is *severely* lacking in features so it looks like 1Password is still my go to for the foreseeable future.
